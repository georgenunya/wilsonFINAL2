                            SUCH DAMAGES OR IF SUCH DAMAGES ARE OTHERWISE FORESEEABLE, AND
                            REGARDLESS OF THE NATURE OF THE CAUSE OF ACTION OR THEORY ASSERTED (E.G.,
                            WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE). ACCESS TO, AND USE OF, THE SITE AND
                            CONTENT IS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND DISCRETION AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY
                            RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR DEVICE OR COMPUTER, OR LOSS OF DATA

                            WHICH ARISES OUT OF OR IS IN ANY WAY CONNECTED TO YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF
                            THE SITE, THE CONTENT OR OTHERWISE, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW,
                            THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE Nunya Marketing PARTIES SHALL IN NO EVENT EXCEED
                            $100 USD. YOU AGREE TO USE YOUR BEST EFFORTS TO MITIGATE ANY DAMAGES OR

                            Because some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or
                            incidental damages, parts of the above limitation may not apply to you. In such jurisdictions, the
                            liability of Nunya Marketing shall be limited to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law.
                            Check your local laws for any restrictions or limitations regarding the limitation of liability for
                            consequential or incidental damages.

                            You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Nunya Marketing, its affiliates, licensees,
                            vendors, partners, identified Site sponsors, and each of their respective directors, officers,

                            actions, losses, damages, liabilities, judgments, settlements, costs and expenses (including, but
                            not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees and court costs) arising out of or relating to (a) your
                            breach of these Terms or any applicable laws or regulations, (b) your access to or use of the Site
                            and/or the Content, (c) your violation, breach or misappropriation of a third party’s copyright,

                            proprietary or other right, (d) your tortious acts including, without limitation, defamation, and/or (e)
                            any claims you may raise against third parties relating to third party products or services. We
                            reserve the right to assume, at our expense, the exclusive defense and control of any matter for
                            which you are required to indemnify us, and you agree to cooperate with our defense of such
                            claims. If we assume such defense, we will be responsible solely for our legal fees in connection
                            with such defense and all other losses, damages, liabilities, judgments, settlements, costs and
                            expenses shall be your sole responsibility.

                            Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a
                            waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and
                            have no legal or contractual effect. If any provision of these Terms is, for any reason, held to be
                            invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will be unimpaired and the invalid or
                            unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the
                            maximum extent permitted by law.
