                            PRIVACY POLICY
                            This policy was last modified on January 4th, 2021.
                            This privacy policy (this "Privacy Policy") describes how we collect, use, and share data that we
                            obtain through your use of the Internet sites, applications, and online services (the "Site")
                            operated by, controlled by, or affiliated with Nunya Marketing.
                            By using the Site, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy and any updates
                            posted here from time to time. To make sure you stay informed of all changes, you should check
                            this Privacy Policy periodically. Updates will be referenced by the "Last Modified" date shown
                            above.
                            1. Collection of Data
                            We collect data from you in several different ways on the Site, including personal data and data
                            about your use of the Site which does not identify you personally. Personal data means
                            information, or combination of information, that can reasonably be used to identify you personally
                            (such as your name, phone number, address, and email address).
                            We collect personal data that you voluntarily provide to us.
                            We collect personal data that you voluntarily provide to us (such as when you submit an inquiry),
                            including name, email address, and any other data you choose to provide.
                            We automatically collect data about your use of the Site.
                            When you access and use the Site, our technology and tools may automatically collect and record
                            certain data about your use of and interaction with the Site that does not identify you personally
                            (such as your IP address, browser type, the make and model of device used to view the Site,
                            unique device identifiers, the referring webpage, pages visited, and search terms).
                            We also use various tracking technologies (such as cookies and pixel tags) to collect data about
                            your use of and access to the Site. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in
                            device memory by websites you visit, applications you use, or advertisements you view and help
                            us improve the Site and your experience on the Site. Pixel tags are electronic images that
                            generate a generic notice of a visit to the Site and are used in conjunction with cookies to
                            anonymously track activity on the Site by a particular browser.
                            Third parties may also automatically collect data about you.
                            Some content on the Site may be served by third-party content providers and may also use
                            cookies, pixels tags, or other similar tracking technologies to automatically collect data about you,
                            both on the Site and throughout the Internet. We do not control the technologies of those third
                            parties. Data collection and use by those third parties is subject to the privacy policies of those
                            third parties. It is up to you to review the terms of use and privacy policies of those third parties.
                            2. Use of Collected Data
                            We use the data we collect to assist in the administration and operation of the Site and to provide
                            you an efficient, meaningful, and customized experience.
                            We may use data to:
                            • Fulfill our obligations with respect to the reason you voluntarily provided the data (such as
                            responding to an inquiry);
                            • Allow you to participate in certain features of the Site;
                            • Improve the Site or our products, events, and services and for other business or
                            commercial purposes;
                            • Optimize your experience on the Site (such as troubleshooting technical programs or
                            storing your preferences);
                            • Notify you about changes to the Site (including this Privacy Policy);
                            • Carry out any other purpose described to you at the time the data was collected; and
                            • Carry out any other purpose with your consent or as permitted by law.
                            Additionally, we may use data for marketing purposes to:
                            • Provide you with additional information regarding products, events, and services from
                            Nunya Marketing via email or through advertising on various social media platforms or
                            websites (both desktop and mobile) that you may visit; and
                            • Develop, improve, and target our promotional messaging to you and others via retargeting,
                            online behavioral advertising, and use of social media platform tools for advertising (such as
                            creation of Facebook Lookalike Audiences).
                            3. Third-Party Websites
                            Through your use of the Site, you may access, directly or indirectly, other websites or services,
                            including from our service providers, business partners, and other third parties, in each case, that
                            are not owned or controlled by us. Data collection and use by those third parties is subject to the
                            privacy policies of those third parties. It is up to you to review the terms of use and privacy
                            policies of those third parties.
                            Please note that when you apply for a job with us through our job application portal, the privacy
                            policy of our job applicant processing partner may also apply to the submission of your
                            application information.
                            4. Sharing of Collected Data
                            We may share the data we collect as follows:
                            • With our current and future parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under
                            common control and ownership;
                            • With our service providers that perform services for us (such as e-mail and mobile
                            marketing, analytics, and web hosting);
                            • With our sponsors or event partners in connection with certain ticketed events;
                            • To comply with a court order or other legal obligation, to enforce the Site terms of use, and
                            to protect the rights, property, or safety of our users and other third parties;
                            • With government or law enforcement officials or private parties (including our legal or other
                            professional advisors) as we determine, in our sole and absolute discretion, is necessary or
                            appropriate to respond to claims or to comply with legal processes, laws, regulations, or
                            ordinances, or to prevent or stop illegal, unethical, or actionable activity;
                            • In connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, acquisition by another company,

                            •
                            5. Transfer of Collected Data
                            The Site is operated in the United Kingdom. If you are located in another jurisdiction, please be
                            aware that the data we collect will be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United
                            Kingdom. By using the Site and/or providing us with any data, you consent to this transfer,
                            processing, and storage of your data in the United Kingdom, a jurisdiction in which the privacy
                            laws may not be as comprehensive as those in the country where you reside or are a citizen such
                            as the European Union. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is
                            treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Notice. We will take all steps reasonably
                            necessary to ensure that your data is subject to appropriate safeguards and ensure that your data
                            is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
                            6. Data Security
                            We use commercially reasonable technical and organizational measures to help secure and
                            safeguard your data in our possession. However, no data transmission over the Internet is
                            completely secure and no security mechanism is impenetrable. Therefore, although we take steps
                            to protect your data, we cannot guarantee the security of the data that we collect from you or the
                            security of our servers or the Site. By accessing the Site, any transmission of data is at your own
                            risk and you agree to assume all risk in connection with data sent to us or collected by us.
                            7. Data Retention
                            We retain data only as long as necessary in light of the purpose(s) for which it was originally
                            collected. Please note that we may retain your data for longer periods of time as necessary to
                            comply with our legal obligations or respond to governmental authorities.
                            8. Children and Parents
                            We respect children's privacy. We do not target or knowingly or intentionally collect personal data
                            from children under the age of 13. By using the Site, you have represented and warranted that
                            you are either at least 18 years of age or using the Site with the supervision of a parent or
                            guardian. If you are under the age of 13, you may not use the Site. If you become aware that your
                            child has provided us with personal data without your consent, please contact us.
                            9. Our "Do Not Track" (DNT) Policy
                            Some websites have "do not track" features that allow you to tell a website not to track you. We
                            do not currently respond to those signals or any similar mechanisms transmitted by web
                            browsers.
                            10. Your Data Preferences
                            Use of Collected Data
                            Communications
                            If you no longer wish to receive communications from Nunya Marketing, please follow the
                            instructions in the emails to opt-out from receiving such messages in the future.
                            Cookies, Pixel Tags, and Other Similar Tracking Technologies
                            You may remove or reject cookies by adjusting settings on your browser, and thus opt-out of
                            certain features of the Site and the Site’s automatic collection of certain data. These tracking
                            technology opt-out tools are device and browser specific so you must repeat the opt-out from
                            each of your devices and browsers. Please note that removing or rejecting cookies could affect
                            the functionality of the Site.
                            Advertising Preferences
